# Next-Word-Prediction
The objective of this project is to build a Next Word Prediction model using  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model should be capable  of predicting the most probable next word given a sequence of words.

Implementation : 
The implementation of the Next Word Prediction model is carried out using Python with libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and NLTK. The core objective is to build a model that, given a sequence of words, can predict the most probable next word using deep learning techniques. The entire process can be broken down into several stages:
1. Data Collection and Preparation : The dataset used is The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle, a public domain literary text rich in language variety and structure. The text is read from a file and converted into lowercase to maintain uniformity. Special characters and punctuations are removed to ensure clean data for tokenization.
2. Tokenization and Sequence Generation : The cleaned text is tokenized using Keras's `Tokenizer`, which assigns a unique integer to each word. The entire text is then broken into multiple n-gram sequences. For example, the sentence “the case was mysterious” would be converted into sequences like:- "the case"- "the case was"- "the case was mysterious" These sequences help the model learn to predict the next word based on varying-length contexts. The sequences are then padded using `pad_sequences` to ensure uniform input length.
3. Model Architecture : A sequential deep learning model is defined using Keras: - Embedding Layer: Converts word indices into dense vectors of fixed size, capturing semantic meaning.- LSTM Layer: Learns the sequential patterns and context in the data.- Dense Output Layer: Uses softmax activation to predict the probability distribution of the next word over the entire vocabulary.
4. Model Compilation and Training : The model is compiled using the `categorical_crossentropy` loss function (suitable for multi-class classification) and the `Adam` optimizer. The training process involves fitting the model on the input sequences with their respective next words as labels. The model learns to minimize the prediction error through multiple epochs.
5. Prediction : After training, the model can be used to predict the next word for any input phrase. A seed text is provided, tokenized, padded, and passed into the model. The predicted word is the one with the highest probability in the output vector.


Future Scope : 
The current implementation of the Next Word Prediction model demonstrates the fundamental capabilities of sequence modeling using LSTM networks. While the model performs reasonably well within the constraints of its dataset, there is significant potential for future improvements and expansion. 
One major area of enhancement is training on larger and more diverse datasets, such as entire book collections, Wikipedia dumps, or news articles. This would enable the model to generalize better and handle a wider variety of inputs. Additionally, implementing more advanced architectures like Bidirectional LSTM, GRU, or Transformer-based models (e.g., GPT or BERT) can further improve prediction accuracy and contextual understanding. Incorporating beam search decoding instead of greedy prediction could generate more accurate and meaningful suggestions. Integrating part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, or syntactic parsing could also help the model understand deeper linguistic structures. Moreover, deploying the model into a web or mobile interface can make it interactive, serving as a typing assistant or smart chatbot component.
